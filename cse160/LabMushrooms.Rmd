This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

The goal for this lab is to become more comfortable with the typical R coding tasks for data science modeling.

Put your name at the top as the author of this R notebook.

Start by reading the mushroom data set from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/agaricus-lepiota.data and storing it in a data frame.
```{r}
mushroom <- read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/mushroom/agaricus-lepiota.data", sep = ",");
```

Sample half of the data for training, and half for testing

```{r}
n <- nrow(mushroom)
mid <- round(n / 2)
train <- mushroom[1:mid,]
test <- mushroom[(mid+1):n,]
```

Build a decision tree to predict edible mushrooms
```{r}
library(rpart)
mushroomTree <- rpart(V1 ~ ., data = train, method = 'class')
mPred <- predict(mushroomTree, test, type='class')
```

Calculate and print accuracy on the test data
```{r}
acc <- mean(mPred == test$V1)
print(paste('Accuracy:', acc))
```

Calculate and print precision and recall on the test data
```{r}
conf <- table(mPred, test$V1, dnn = c("pred.", "act."))
tp <- conf[1,1]
fp <- conf[1,2]
fn <- conf[2,1]
tn <- conf[2,2]
prec <- tp / (tp + fp)
recall <- tp / (tp + fn)
print(paste('Precision:', prec))
print(paste('Recall:', recall))
```

Do the same for another predictive method.  Your choice which method (presumably one that we have covered already).
```{r}
#install.packages("kknn")
library(kknn)
#remove constants
train$V7 <- NULL
train$V17 <- NULL
train$V18 <- NULL
test$V7 <- NULL
test$V17 <- NULL
test$V18 <- NULL
#K-Nearest Neighbor
#generate model, setting k = sqrt(n) where n is rows in training data
kknnModel <- kknn(V1 ~ ., train = train, test = test, k = round(nrow(train)^.5))
#predict test data
kknnPred <- predict(kknnModel)
#create confusion matrix
conf <- table(kknnPred, test$V1, dnn = c("pred.", "act."))
#calculate accuracy
print(paste('Accuracy:', mean(kknnPred == test$V1)))
tp <- conf[1,1]
fp <- conf[1,2]
fn <- conf[2,1]
tn <- conf[2,2]
prec <- tp / (tp + fp)
recall <- tp / (tp + fn)
print(paste('Precision:', prec))
print(paste('Recall:', recall))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
