== Homework 7 ==

== Question 1 ==
B->D, D->A
Transitivity Rule: B->A
B->A, A->BDG
Transitivity Rule: B->BDG
B->BDG
Decomposition Rule: B->D, B->BG
B->BG, BG->DE
Transitivity Rule: B->DE
B->DE
Decomposition Rule: B->D, B->E
B->E

== Question 2 ==
B->DE proved above
B->D is extraneous because B->DE
D is extraneous in A->BDG because B->D
G is extraneous in BG->DE because B->DE
D->A, B->DE, A->BG
No other extraneous solutions, so it is a canonical cover.

== Question 3 ==
Since the intersection of the two relations (B) is not a super key of either relation, then the decomposition is lossy.
Example:
1, 2, 3
3, 2, 1
result:
1, 2, 3
1, 2, 1
3, 2, 3
3, 2, 1
OR
School, State, City
Lehigh, PA, Pittsburg
Lafayette, PA, Philadelphia
result:
Lehigh, PA, Pittsburg
Lafayette, PA, Philadelphia
Lehigh, PA, Philadelphia
Lafayette, PA, Pittsburg

== Question 4 ==
A+ = A,B,D,E,G  (C is missing)
BG+ = A,B,D,E,G    ^^
B+ = A,B,D,E,G     ^^
D+ = A,B,D,E,G     ^^
A is not a super key, so R is not in BCNF
Add E->AC to include the missing C and make everything a super key, which makes this in BCNF
